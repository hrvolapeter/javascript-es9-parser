The idea is that where one would normally store a `Box<dyn FnOnce()>` in a data structure, you should use `Box<dyn FnBox()>`. The two traits behave essentially the same, except that a `FnBox` closure can only be called if it is boxed. (Note that `FnBox` may be deprecated in the future if `Box<dyn FnOnce()>` closures become directly usable.)"]]});
